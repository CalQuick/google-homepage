So this is one of the first exercises through the Odin Project. So far I've done the codecademy course to understand the basics of html and using boxes with CSS.

I've learnt to set up a repository using git / github on terminal (ubuntu).

	1.  Set up the repository on github.com
	2.  Copy the url of the new repository (https://github.com/CalQuick/google-homepage)
	3.  cd into where I want this repository stored on my local machine.
	4.  git clone https://github.com/CalQuick/google-homepage to set up the repository
	5.  Create this readme file with touch README.md
	6.  Add this file to the staging area with 
		git add README.md
	7.  Check which files haven't been updated to the repository with 
		git status
	8.  Commit changes to the files with
		git commit -m "comments here"
	9.  Upload files to git with
		git push origin master	
	10. Check 
		git status one last time
	11. Check the history of my repository with
		git log
